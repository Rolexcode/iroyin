# Brand — Ìròyìn

_Status: deferred_

The user chose to defer brand setup. This project is currently using an accessible neutral palette and no custom brand typography. The `frontend-design-guidelines` skill will quietly use defaults and will not prompt again.

To set up a real brand palette, typography, and voice at any time, run:

    /brand-design

or say: "pick brand colors"

When `brand-design` runs, it will detect this deferred state, skip the "confirm overwrite" step, and proceed directly to the full brand setup. The resulting palette will be applied to `src/app/globals.css` and this file will be replaced with the real brand documentation.
